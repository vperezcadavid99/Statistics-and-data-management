**Project Descriptions:**

**1. NBA Division Statistics** 

This project focuses on statistical analysis of NBA divisions. It explores various metrics, trends, and performance indicators within different NBA divisions during the 2023-2024 season.

**2. Statistical Analysis of Vehicular Flow.ipynb**

The following script presents a statistical analysis carried out on the vehicular flow on a type of car with specific characteristics near the regional avenue in the city of Medellín.

**3. Statistical Test for Distribution Functions.ipynb**

3 experimental situations are analyzed (“ej1a.csv”, “ej1b.csv”,“ej1c.csv”), which are analyzed with different distribution functions: poisson, normal and binomial.
Additionally, the chi-square test is used to determine which is the best distribution that describes the experimental data.

**4. Academic Classifier**

In the following script a Dataframe is created with student information, which is used as a template for future classification analysis in educational institutions.

**5. Manipulation and Analysis of Datasets.ipynb**

This notebook focuses on the manipulation and analysis of datasets. It covers techniques for data cleaning, preprocessing and visualization.

**6. Exploratory data analysis and machine learning models**

In this notebook an exploratory data analysis is performed for the “Iris” data set. Machine learning models are also implemented to make observations and predictions on the data.
